## Some SQL 

This post will have some handy SQL queries.
Below there are some simple scenarios that I have encountered.

### MaxMax AND GROUP BY

Example 

So, you want to get latest start date for an employee(s) who have more than 15 subordinates

```*.sql
SELECT  MAX(MAX(start_date))
FROM    employees
WHERE   emp_type = 'sub'
GRUOP   BY start_date
HAVING  COUNT(*) > 15;
```


### Delete duplicate rows

```*.sql
SELECT	<selected_column>,
COUNT	(ani_id) AS NumOccurrences
FROM	<table_name>
GROUP 	BY <selected_column>
HAVING 	(COUNT(<selected_column>) > 1 )


DELETE 
FROM	<table name> A
WHERE	ROWID > (SELECT min(rowid)
FROM	<table name> B
WHERE 	a.<selected_column> = b.<selected_column>);

```
